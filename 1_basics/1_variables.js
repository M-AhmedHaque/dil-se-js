const email = "muhammadahmedhaque@gmail.com"

//we can declare varible using 3 ways: var, let, or just name

var username = "Muhammad Ahmed Haque" //never use this, it is an early js thing and it had problems with scope, if you have declare a var in a file or block then if you declare var again with that same name it will see both as same and will overwrite the value

let password = "sachmainyehiha" //then to solve issue of scope let was introduced.

id = 12312412 //this can also declare new variable but not recommended.

// email="mahmedhaq@gmail.com" cant do

console.table([id,email,username,password])
